# Alarm Clock Java Project #
## Context ##
The purposes of this project is to enhance my capabilities of programming in Java.  This project is based on the project idea [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerprojects/comments/4n9hne/project_idea_alarm_clock/).  Below is the proposed project if the link does not work:

>Make a program that accepts command line arguments for what time to go off, and when it does it should launch a Youtube video in your browser that will start playing.
>The program should read in a text file that contains URLs to different Youtube videos and will randomly choose one and launch it. My command line args were in the form of --hour <hour> --minute <minute> --<pm/am> but you should do whatever you feel is easiest or most convenient for you.

There are some variations to this project to make it better.
