Make a program that accepts command line arguments for what time to go off, and when it does it should launch a Youtube video in your browser that will start playing.
The program should read in a text file that contains URLs to different Youtube videos and will randomly choose one and launch it. My command line args were in the form of --hour <hour> --minute <minute> --<pm/am> but you should do whatever you feel is easiest or most convenient for you.
